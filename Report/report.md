Problem 2:

The Acer Ebii e-bike and the conventional bicycle both serve as efficient means of personal transportation, making them similar in purpose. However, the Ebii enhances the cycling experience with modern features like automatic locking, GPS for theft protection, and smart technology that adjusts the electric assistance based on the rider’s effort and terrain. While traditional bicycles are straightforward and dependable, the Ebii offers added convenience and ease of use, appealing to today's eco-conscious riders. This evolution reflects a growing trend towards integrating technology with sustainability in personal mobility, making the Ebii a relevant choice in the current market.

Problem 6:

I’ve decided to take a global approach in analyzing the diffusion of the Acer Ebii e-bike. Acer, being a well-known international company, is likely to market the Ebii in many countries around the world. My dataset reflects this, as it includes information from regions like the United States, Australia, Germany, France, and Canada, all of which have a growing interest in e-bikes.

The cumulative sales predictions based on the Bass Model show a consistent increase in adoption, and this trend is expected to continue as electric transportation gains more traction globally. With the rising demand for eco-friendly travel solutions worldwide, it makes sense to look at this from a global perspective, giving us a broader view of how the Ebii might be adopted in various markets
